It contains all the information necessary to execute the\nflow run as a Docker container.\n\nAttributes:\n    name: The name to give to created Docker containers.\n    command: The command executed in created Docker containers to kick off\n        flow run execution.\n    env: The environment variables to set in created Docker containers.\n    labels: The labels to set on created Docker containers.\n    image: The image reference of a container image to use for created jobs.\n        If not set, the latest Prefect image will be used.\n    image_pull_policy: The image pull policy to use when pulling images.\n    networks: Docker networks that created containers should be connected to.\n    network_mode: The network mode for the created containers (e.g. host, bridge).\n        If 'networks' is set, this cannot be set.\n    auto_remove: If set, containers will be deleted on completion.\n    volumes: Docker volumes that should be mounted in created containers.\n    stream_output: If set, the output from created containers will be streamed\n        to local standard output.\n    mem_limit: Memory limit of created containers. Accepts a value\n        with a unit identifier (e.g. 100000b, 1000k, 128m, 1g.) If a value is\n        given without a unit, bytes are assumed.\n    memswap_limit: Total memory (memory + swap), -1 to disable swap. Should only be\n        set if `mem_limit` is also set. If `mem_limit` is set, this defaults to\n        allowing the container to use as much swap as memory. For example, if\n        `mem_limit` is 300m and `memswap_limit` is not set, containers can use\n        600m in total of memory and swap.\n    privileged: Give extended privileges to created containers.\n\nDocs: https://docs.prefect.io/latest/integrations/prefect-docker/worker/?h=networks#prefect_docker.worker.DockerWorkerJobConfiguration"
